ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tulga (Tulga-Erdene Sodjargal / á ²á ¤á ¯á ­á Žá  -á ¡á ·á ³á ¡á ¨á ¢) ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡³

I'm currently a 3rd year student at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) in Daejeon, Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·

Currently, I'm studying Bioengineering with a double major in Chemistry and AI Specialized Major.

At the moment, I am in Therapeutic Protein Design and Structural Bio Lab (of Prof. Byung-Ha Oh), studying physics- and ML-based methods of protein design. 

Before that, I did 1 year of undergraduate research in Sustainable Catalysis Lab (of Prof. Yoonsu Park), where I researched on organic reaction development using catalyst optimization.

From high school, I have experience in robotics (FIRST) and debates (MUN), as well as native fluency of English and Russian.
